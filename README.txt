I complete my scrum meeting with Dibyendu Brinto Bose(brintodibyendu@vt.edu) in person

What I did: I completed "Basci shell", "coding" activities.
WHat I need to do next: I am going to complete API's activities and the stand up meeting on Project Management page and update the task status on github project.
WHat is blocking me: managing The management of personal access token on github is annoying because the generated token won't be saved automatically on the github page. 

Brinto:
What he did: I completed API, CODING, BASIC SHELL windows with installation.
Whay he need to do next: Only thing that I had to do was to complete the project managment and scrum task
WHat is blocking hm: The blocking was the in person meetup with my partner which I overcame during class
